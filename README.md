It's very basic and partially incomplete. Please don't judge it too harshly. Made because the existing terraria save handlers suck.

Usage:
`node ./Read.js <path to .plr>`

Creates `Player.json` in the script directory. Edit the JSON and then press enter in the terminal window to overwrite the provided path with the new data. Backups are made to `Backup` using the current timestamp, but always manually create backups before doing save mods.
